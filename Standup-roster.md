# Schedule for stand-up "driver"

## What needs to be done?

- Create a date-stamped copy of the standup-template.md file and update agenda
- Prepare to discuss a topic of interest for the stand-up. This can be:
    - An interesting solution to a problem you have encountered
    - A new module/library/approach that you think is interesting/useful to share
    - A demonstration of work that is interesting/challenging
    - A discussion of something that you think would be worth considering from a code practice/special project admin perspective
    - Anything else that you think might be of general interest to the wider team
- Prepare to lead the stand-up on the Friday

You can swap around your scheduled week as needed, but please update this document when you do so.
