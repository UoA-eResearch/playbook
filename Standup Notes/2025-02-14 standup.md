### Notes

- Transcription seems to have worked this week.
- No specific challenges/blockers were identified for any projects.
- Discussion around the use of Git and merge conflicts
    - ```git fetch``` vs ```git pull```
    - Suggest that ```git fetch``` be the default to avoid conflicts, then decide whether to merge
    - Encourage good practice, but given the scale of the projects, it's not necessary to mandate it
- Worth considering when code review is needed
- Friday discussions to be kept on an ad-hoc basis, though potential topics to be added to the agenda
before CoB Thursday.

## Actions

- Update the playbook to include non-semantic versioning.
- Add summary of minimal Git commit message to playbook.
