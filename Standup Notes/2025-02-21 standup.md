## Notes

- Challenges
    - Nic Malone's illegal wildlife trade project - not much need for scripting at this point in time, mostly limited to advice. Nic needs to approach legal regarding the nature of what might be accessed in the Dark Web.

- Upcoming week:
    - Nidhi - model testing and optimisation of the Whisper AI model used
    - Nidhi - containerisation of the Whisper AI model
    - Noel - upskilling in the use of ansible ready to implement a containerised version of the model
    - Noel - front end stuff for Whisper
    - Nick prep work for Cagliari - whole coast vs high erodability beaches

- Multi modal LLM - summary from Nidhi
    - Technical report
    - Deepseek better? No +86 number so couldn't test it
    - Principles - optimising could be really useful for us to implement
    - Some techniques slightly different
    - Llama 32 vision multi modal and open source
        - 8B 22 G RAM - python Jupyter Notebook on GitHub
    - Batched cost function parallelisation - useful for us
    - Hunyuan - one line docker container <- simple GUI Nick to provide link - make little videos
        - Some understanding of physics
    - Simon Ingram's project

## Actions

- Nidhi to investigate Hunyuan and Suno or similar for visualisation of the health of an eco-system
